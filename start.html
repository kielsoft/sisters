            A common English usage misconception is that a paragraph has three to five sentences;
            single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists
            often use single-sentence paragraphs.[1]
            English students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a topic
            sentence or "main idea", preferably first, and multiple "supporting" or "detail"
            sentences that explain or supply evidence. One technique of this type, intended for
            essay writing, is known as the Schaffer paragraph. This advice differs from stock
            advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese
